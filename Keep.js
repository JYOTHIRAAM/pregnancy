        <span class="v44_5">Experts agree, when you're expecting, it's important to keep moving. People who exercise during pregnancy have less back pain, more energy, a better body image, and a smoother recovery post-delivery.<br></br><br></br>
   Being fit during pregnancy doesn't have to mean a big time commitment or fancy equipment. The following workout is simple, can be done at home, and is safe to do in each trimester.<br></br><br></br>
  Be sure to do the moves in the order shown and, for best results, do the workout every other day. Always check with your prenatal care provider before starting this or any exercise program</span>
