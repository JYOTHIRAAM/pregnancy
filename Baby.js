make collagen – a protein that provides structure to cartilage, tendons, bones and skin, as well as helping your body to fight infections</span>

and eyelids will now be visible.

your baby bump is probably obvious by this point.
You may start to feel baby’s kicks in this month!</span>

this month. 
To manage this, avoid excess salt (and processed foods) 
and make sure you are keeping up your hydration.</span>
